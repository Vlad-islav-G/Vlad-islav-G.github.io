        <h2>What Are Cookies?</h2>

        <!-- Why Do Websites Use Cookies Section -->
        <h2>Why Do Websites Use Cookies?</h2>
        <p>Imagine you walk into your favorite coffee shop. The barista remembers your usual order and prepares it for you. That‚Äôs what cookies do for websites‚Äîthey <strong>help sites remember you</strong>.</p>

        <p>Some common reasons websites use cookies:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Remembering Logins:</strong> So you don‚Äôt have to type your username and password every time.</li>
            <li><strong>Saving Preferences:</strong> Like language settings or dark mode.</li>
            <li><strong>Keeping Track of Items:</strong> If you're shopping online, cookies remember what‚Äôs in your cart.</li>
            <li><strong>Showing You Ads:</strong> Some cookies track your activity to show ads based on your interests.</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>

        <!-- Types of Cookies Section -->
        <h2>Different Types of Cookies</h2>
        <p>Not all cookies work the same way. Here are the main types:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Session Cookies:</strong> These disappear when you close your browser. They‚Äôre temporary and help websites work while you‚Äôre using them.</li>
            <li><strong>Persistent Cookies:</strong> These stay on your device for a set time, even after closing your browser.</li>
            <li><strong>Third-Party Cookies:</strong> These come from advertisers or other companies tracking your online behavior.</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>

        <!-- Are Cookies Safe? Section -->
        <h2>Are Cookies Safe?</h2>
        <p>Most cookies are harmless, but some can track your activity across different websites. This is why many browsers let you <strong>block third-party cookies</strong> or delete cookies when you close your browser.</p>

        <!-- How to Control Cookies Section -->
        <h2>How to Control Cookies</h2>
        <p>If you want more control over cookies, here‚Äôs what you can do:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Go to your browser settings and clear cookies.</li>
            <li>Block third-party cookies in your browser.</li>
            <li>Use <strong>incognito mode</strong> to prevent sites from saving cookies.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Cookies help websites remember things, but it‚Äôs good to know how to manage them!</p>
